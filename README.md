This project involves a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing data using Power BI, focusing on data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to derive meaningful insights for decision-making. The project is divided into two main parts: Data Cleaning and Modeling and Dashboard Building.

Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX in Power BI
In the first part of the project, I performed the following steps:

Data Importing and Preliminary Examination: Imported two datasets into Power BI and conducted an initial examination to identify any anomalies or inconsistencies.

Cleaning: Addressed missing data, duplicate entries, and irrelevant data points to ensure high data quality.

Merging and Relating Datasets: Merged the datasets based on a suitable key, retaining all necessary information.

Data Type Conversion: Transformed and normalized data to ensure consistency across datasets.

Categorizing Product Types: Created new product categories based on the 'ProductType' column, enhancing analysis capabilities.

Production Cost Analysis: Calculated average production costs for each product type, identifying which type had the highest average cost.

Employee Distribution Analysis: Analyzed employee distribution across departments to determine which department has the most employees.

Country-Based Operations Analysis: Investigated which country had the highest number of employees and average production levels.

Performance Rating Analysis: Used DAX to analyze average performance ratings by department, exploring correlations with departmental performance.

Warehouse Efficiency: Evaluated the average quantity of products stored in various warehouse locations to identify the most utilized ones.

Salary Trends: Analyzed salary trends over time, highlighting any noticeable increases or disparities.

Salary and Performance Correlation: Explored correlations between employee salaries and performance ratings.

Manufacturing Trends: Analyzed trends in the manufacturing of different product types over time, identifying any seasonal patterns.

Cost Analysis by Country: Investigated average production costs per product in each country, highlighting the highest and lowest costs.

Employee Tenure: Calculated and analyzed the distribution of employee tenure within the organization.

Production and Sales Correlation: Created measures to analyze the correlation between production quantity and employee performance in sales.

Product Lifecycle Analysis: Analyzed product lifecycles based on production dates and quantities.

Cost Efficiency Analysis: Explored cost efficiency of production using advanced DAX measures.

Employee Training Insights: Extracted key information from the 'Employee Training Record', creating columns for training dates and types.

Operational vs. Origin Country Analysis: Compared countries of operation and origin in terms of production and employee performance.

Role Impact on Production Costs: Analyzed the impact of certain departments and employee roles on production costs.

Predictive Modeling: Created a predictive model using DAX to estimate future product demand based on historical data.

Time Series Forecasting: Performed time series forecasting on production costs, predicting costs for the upcoming quarter.

Identifying Production Anomalies: Utilized Power BI's capabilities to identify anomalies in production data.


Part 2: Dashboard Building
In the second part of the project, I created an interactive and comprehensive dashboard that showcases key manufacturing metrics, including:

Manufacturing Dashboard: Developed a dashboard displaying metrics such as production costs, employee distribution, performance ratings, and product trends, complete with filters for department, country, and product type.

Dashboard Design and Functionality: Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly, visually appealing, and interactive to facilitate data exploration.

Time-Based Analysis: Incorporated time-based visualizations to analyze production trends and salary progression effectively.

Employee Data Interaction: Enabled interactive analysis of employee data, covering performance, department distribution, and salary trends.

Production and Cost Visualization: Implemented effective visualizations to display production volumes and cost data, providing insights into operational efficiency and trends.

Key Insights and Data Storytelling: Included a summary section that highlights significant findings and trends from the data analysis, emphasizing key insights that emerged during the project.


Conclusion
This Power BI project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of data visualization and analysis, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into manufacturing operations. Through comprehensive data cleaning, modeling, and effective dashboard design, the project aims to enhance decision-making processes and operational efficiency within the manufacturing sector.

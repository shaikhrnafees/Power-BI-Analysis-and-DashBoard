## Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX
In the first part of the project, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Importing and Preliminary Examination:** Imported two datasets into Power BI and conducted an initial examination to identify any anomalies or inconsistencies.

2. **Cleaning:** Addressed missing data, duplicate entries, and irrelevant data points to ensure high data quality.

3. **Merging and Relating Datasets:** Merged the datasets based on a suitable key, retaining all necessary information.

4. **Data Type Conversion:** Transformed and normalized data to ensure consistency across datasets.

5. **Categorizing Product Types:** Created new product categories based on the 'ProductType' column, enhancing analysis capabilities.

6. **Production Cost Analysis:** Calculated average production costs for each product type, identifying which type had the highest average cost.

7. **Employee Distribution Analysis:** Analyzed employee distribution across departments to determine which department has the most employees.

8. **Country-Based Operations Analysis:** Investigated which country had the highest number of employees and average production levels.

9. **Performance Rating Analysis:** Used DAX to analyze average performance ratings by department, exploring correlations with departmental performance.

10. **Warehouse Efficiency:** Evaluated the average quantity of products stored in various warehouse locations to identify the most utilized ones.

11. **Salary Trends:** Analyzed salary trends over time, highlighting any noticeable increases or disparities.

12. **Salary and Performance Correlation:** Explored correlations between employee salaries and performance ratings.

13. **Manufacturing Trends:** Analyzed trends in the manufacturing of different product types over time, identifying any seasonal patterns.

14. **Cost Analysis by Country:** Investigated average production costs per product in each country, highlighting the highest and lowest costs.

15. **Employee Tenure:** Calculated and analyzed the distribution of employee tenure within the organization.

16. **Production and Sales Correlation:** Created measures to analyze the correlation between production quantity and employee performance in sales.

17. **Product Lifecycle Analysis:** Analyzed product lifecycles based on production dates and quantities.

18. **Cost Efficiency Analysis:** Explored cost efficiency of production using advanced DAX measures.

19. **Employee Training Insights:** Extracted key information from the 'Employee Training Record', creating columns for training dates and types.

20. **Operational vs. Origin Country Analysis:** Compared countries of operation and origin in terms of production and employee performance.

21. **Role Impact on Production Costs:** Analyzed the impact of certain departments and employee roles on production costs.

22. **Predictive Modeling:** Created a predictive model using DAX to estimate future product demand based on historical data.

23. **Time Series Forecasting:** Performed time series forecasting on production costs, predicting costs for the upcoming quarter.

24. **Identifying Production Anomalies:** Utilized Power BI's capabilities to identify anomalies in production data.

## Part 2: Dashboard Building
In the second part of the project, I created an interactive and comprehensive dashboard that showcases key manufacturing metrics, including:

- **Manufacturing Dashboard:** Developed a dashboard displaying metrics such as production costs, employee distribution, performance ratings, and product trends, complete with filters for department, country, and product type.

- **Dashboard Design and Functionality:** Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly, visually appealing, and interactive to facilitate data exploration.

- **Time-Based Analysis:** Incorporated time-based visualizations to analyze production trends and salary progression effectively.

- **Employee Data Interaction:** Enabled interactive analysis of employee data, covering performance, department distribution, and salary trends.

- **Production and Cost Visualization:** Implemented effective visualizations to display production volumes and cost data, providing insights into operational efficiency and trends.
